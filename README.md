# kendrafitzgerald-reactportfolio

## Description

Hi! I'm Kendra and this project is a portfolio of some of my recent works as a Software Developer. A portfolio is essential to a developer as it is a site where potential employers can view the developer's projects, resume, biography, and contact the developer. I was motivated to create this portfolio to meet the above criteria and to showcase the skills I have learned working with React and JavaScript. In this project, I utilized React and JS primarily to conditionally render the components of the portfolio, creating my first React app. Not only does this project solve the problem of building a professional portfolio, it also solves the problem of applying my existing and newly learned skills to create a functioning application.


## Usage
When you first visit my portfolio site, the 'About Me' page will render first on screen. To view the 'Portfolio', 'Contact', and 'Resume' sections, simply click on the corresponding navigation tab. If you wish to return to the 'About Me' page, reload the site or click on the corresponding tab. On the 'Portfolio' page, if you click a the photo of the project you will be redirected to the deployed site or a walkthrough video if it is a backend app. If you click on the GitHub icon/repo text, you will be redirected to the repo of that project on GitHub. On the 'Contact Me' page, there are fields to enter your name, email, and a message. You will be notified if you fail to enter a field or if you enter an invalid email. The button under the form will send your message. On the 'Resume' page, my resume is rendered on screen as a PDF and there is a link to click that will download my resume onto your device. Finally, there is a GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter icon as the footer on the page. If you click on one of these icons, you will be redirected to the site of that icon.
